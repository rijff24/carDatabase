# Business Logic

This document details the key calculations, business rules, and workflows implemented in the Car Repair and Sales Tracking Application.

## Key Calculations

### Car Profit Calculation

The profit from a car sale is calculated as the difference between the sale price and total investment:

```python
def profit(self):
    """Calculate profit from sale"""
    if not self.sale_price:
        return None
    return self.sale_price - (self.purchase_price + self.total_repair_cost + self.refuel_cost)
```

Where:
- `sale_price`: Final selling price of the car
- `purchase_price`: Original price paid to acquire the car
- `total_repair_cost`: Sum of all repair costs for the car
- `refuel_cost`: Cost of refueling the car

This calculation is implemented as a property on the `Car` model and is computed dynamically rather than stored in the database.

### Commission Calculation

The commission for a car sale is determined based on profit thresholds:

```python
def commission(self):
    """Calculate commission based on profit"""
    profit = self.profit
    if profit is None:
        return None
    return 10000 if profit > 30000 else 5000
```

Commission rules:
- If profit is greater than 30,000, commission is 10,000
- Otherwise, commission is 5,000

This calculation is also implemented as a property on the `Car` model.

### Profit Margin Calculation

The profit margin percentage for a sale is calculated as:

```python
def profit_margin(self):
    """Calculate profit margin as a percentage"""
    if not self.sale_price or float(self.sale_price) == 0:
        return 0
    return (self.profit / float(self.sale_price)) * 100
```

This gives the profit as a percentage of the selling price, which is a common business metric for evaluating sales performance.

### Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation

The return on investment is calculated as:

```python
def roi(self):
    """Calculate return on investment as a percentage"""
    if not self.profit or not self.total_investment or float(self.total_investment) == 0:
        return 0
    return (self.profit / float(self.total_investment)) * 100
```

This metric evaluates how efficiently the business is using its capital by showing the percentage return on the total investment made in the vehicle.

#### ROI Performance Categories

For reporting and analysis purposes, ROI is categorized into three performance bands:

```python
def get_roi_band(roi):
    """Determine ROI color band (high, medium, low)"""
    if roi >= 30.0:
        return "high"
    elif roi >= 15.0:
        return "medium"
    else:
        return "low"
```

- **High ROI (â‰¥30%)**: Represents excellent investment performance
- **Medium ROI (15-30%)**: Represents good investment performance
- **Low ROI (<15%)**: Represents below-target investment performance

These categorizations are used in the Profitability Report for color-coding and visual analysis, helping to quickly identify high-performing and underperforming vehicles.

### Top & Bottom Cars Profitability Analysis

The dashboard's Top & Bottom Cars Profitability card implements specific business logic to highlight the best and worst performing vehicles:

```python
# Get top 3 cars by profit in past 60 days
sixty_days_ago = datetime.now().date() - timedelta(days=60)
top_profit_cars = Car.query.filter(Car.date_sold >= sixty_days_ago).all()
# Sort by profit (highest to lowest) and get top 3
top_profit_cars = sorted([car for car in top_profit_cars if car.profit is not None], 
                        key=lambda x: x.profit, reverse=True)[:3]

# Get bottom 3 cars by profit or unsold cars beyond aging threshold
aging_threshold_date = current_date - timedelta(days=stand_aging_threshold_days)

# Get cars that have been on display too long (exceeding aging threshold)
aging_cars = Car.query.filter(
    Car.date_added_to_stand <= aging_threshold_date,
    Car.date_sold == None,
    Car.repair_status == 'On Display'
).all()

# Also get recent low-profit sales
bottom_profit_cars = Car.query.filter(Car.date_sold >= sixty_days_ago).all()
# Sort by profit (lowest to highest)
bottom_profit_cars = sorted([car for car in bottom_profit_cars if car.profit is not None], 
                           key=lambda x: x.profit)[:3]
```

The implementation follows these business rules:

1. **Top Cars Selection:**
   - Only considers vehicles sold within the past 60 days
   - Ranks by absolute profit value (highest to lowest)
   - Displays the top 3 performers

2. **Bottom Cars Selection - Hybrid Approach:**
   - Prioritizes aging inventory (cars on display longer than the aging threshold)
   - If fewer than 3 aging cars exist, fills the remaining slots with lowest-profit recent sales
   - Combines operational concerns (aging inventory) with financial performance (low profit)

3. **Display Logic:**
   - Profit values are color-coded (green for top performers, red for negative profits)
   - Status indicators differentiate between aging inventory and low-profit sold vehicles
   - Links to detailed profit reports for deeper analysis

This approach provides a balanced view that addresses both immediate profitability concerns and inventory management issues in a single widget.

### Days in Reconditioning Calculation

The number of days a car spent in reconditioning is calculated as:

```python
def days_in_recon(self):
    """Calculate days in reconditioning"""
    if not self.date_added_to_stand or not self.date_bought:
        return None
    return (self.date_added_to_stand - self.date_bought).days
```

This calculation measures the time from vehicle purchase to when it's ready for display, which is an important operational efficiency metric.

### Average Reconditioning Time Calculation

For the dashboard's "Ready for Display" card, the application calculates the average time cars spend in reconditioning before they reach the "Ready for Display" status:

```python
# Count cars ready for display and calculate average recon time
cars_ready_for_display = Car.query.filter(
    Car.repair_status == 'Ready for Display',
    Car.date_sold == None
).all()

ready_for_display_count = len(cars_ready_for_display)

# Calculate average reconditioning time (days from purchase to 'Ready for Display' status)
recon_times = []
current_date = datetime.now().date()

for car in cars_ready_for_display:
    if car.date_bought:
        # For cars with date_bought, calculate days to reach 'Ready for Display'
        # In a full implementation, you would use the actual date the status changed
        recon_time = (current_date - car.date_bought).days
        if recon_time >= 0:  # Ensure we don't include negative values
            recon_times.append(recon_time)

avg_recon_time = sum(recon_times) / len(recon_times) if recon_times else None
```

This calculation uses the current date as a proxy for when the car reached "Ready for Display" status. In a full implementation, the system would store the exact date each car's status changed to provide more accurate reconditioning time metrics.

The average reconditioning time is a critical business metric as it:
- Helps identify bottlenecks in the repair process
- Allows for better prediction of when cars will be available for sale
- Provides insights into operational efficiency
- Can be used to optimize resource allocation

### Days on Stand Calculation

The number of days a car spent on the display stand is calculated as:

```python
def days_on_stand(self):
    """Calculate days on stand"""
    if not self.date_sold or not self.date_added_to_stand:
        return None
    return (self.date_sold - self.date_added_to_stand).days
```

This calculation measures how long it takes to sell a vehicle once it's on display, which is a key metric for sales velocity.

### Total Repair Cost Calculation

The total cost of all repairs for a car is calculated by summing the costs of individual repairs:

```python
def total_repair_cost(self):
    """Calculate total repair costs for this car"""
    return sum(float(repair.repair_cost) for repair in self.repairs.all())
```

This aggregates all repair costs associated with a vehicle.

### Total Investment Calculation

The total investment in a car is calculated as:

```python
def total_investment(self):
    """Calculate total investment in the car"""
    repair_cost = self.total_repair_cost or 0
    refuel = float(self.refuel_cost) if self.refuel_cost else 0
    purchase = float(self.purchase_price) if self.purchase_price else 0
    return purchase + repair_cost + refuel
```

This represents the total amount invested in the vehicle before sale.

### Repair Duration Calculation

The duration of a repair is calculated as:

```python
def duration_days(self):
    if not self.end_date or not self.start_date:
        return None
    return (self.end_date - self.start_date).days
```

This measures how long a repair takes to complete, which is important for tracking repair efficiency.

### Parts Cost for Repair Calculation

The total cost of parts used in a repair is calculated by summing the costs of all parts:

```python
def parts_cost(self):
    return sum(rp.total_cost for rp in self.repair_parts)
```

This aggregates the costs of all parts used in a specific repair.

## Business Rules

### Vehicle Status Management

The application enforces specific rules around vehicle status transitions:

1. **Status Workflow**:
   - New vehicles start with status "Waiting for Repairs"
   - After repair completion, status changes to "Ready for Display"
   - When added to a stand, status changes to "On Display"
   - When sold, status changes to "Sold"

2. **Status Validation**:
   ```python
   VALID_STATUSES = ['Waiting for Repairs', 'In Repair', 'Ready for Display', 'On Display', 'Sold']
   
   if status not in VALID_STATUSES:
       raise ValidationError(f"Invalid status: {status}")
   ```

3. **Status Transition Rules**:
   ```python
   def change_status(self, new_status):
       # Only allow sale status to be set when sale_price and date_sold are set
       if new_status == 'Sold' and (not self.sale_price or not self.date_sold):
           raise ValidationError("Cannot mark as sold without sale price and date")
       
       # Cannot add to display without stand_id
       if new_status == 'On Display' and not self.stand_id:
           raise ValidationError("Cannot display without assigning to a stand")
       
       # Update status
       self.repair_status = new_status
   ```

### Stand Capacity Management

Stands have capacity limits that must be enforced:

```python
def add_car_to_stand(self, car):
    # Check if stand has capacity
    if not self.space_available:
        raise ValidationError(f"Stand {self.name} is at capacity ({self.capacity})")
    
    # Remove car from any existing stand
    if car.stand_id:
        car.stand.remove_car(car)
    
    # Update car
    car.stand_id = self.stand_id
    car.current_location = self.location
    car.date_added_to_stand = datetime.now().date()
    car.repair_status = 'On Display'
```

### Sale Recording Rules

When recording a sale, several validations are performed:

```python
def record_sale(self, sale_price, sale_date, dealer_id, **kwargs):
    # Cannot sell a car that's already sold
    if self.date_sold:
        raise ValidationError("Car has already been sold")
    
    # Cannot sell a car that's not on display
    if self.repair_status != 'On Display':
        raise ValidationError("Car must be on display before it can be sold")
    
    # Update car details
    self.sale_price = sale_price
    self.date_sold = sale_date
    self.repair_status = 'Sold'
    
    # Create sale record
    sale = Sale(
        car_id=self.car_id,
        dealer_id=dealer_id,
        sale_price=sale_price,
        sale_date=sale_date,
        **kwargs
    )
    
    return sale
```

### User Role-Based Permissions

The application implements role-based access control:

```python
def requires_role(role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if not current_user.is_authenticated:
                return redirect(url_for('auth.login'))
                
            if role == 'admin' and not current_user.is_admin():
                abort(403)
                
            if role == 'manager' and not current_user.is_manager():
                abort(403)
                
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator
```

Access rules:
- Admin users can access all features
- Managers can access everything except user management
- Regular users have limited access based on their specific role
- Some features are only available to specific roles

### Aging Vehicle Thresholds

The application includes configurable thresholds for vehicle aging on stands:

```python
def is_aging(self):
    """Check if a car has been on stand too long without selling"""
    if not self.date_added_to_stand or self.date_sold:
        return False
        
    # Get the aging threshold from settings
    threshold_days = Setting.get_setting('stand_aging_threshold_days', 180)
    days_on_stand = (datetime.now().date() - self.date_added_to_stand).days
    
    return days_on_stand >= threshold_days
```

This logic is used to flag vehicles that may require price adjustments or other interventions to increase the chance of sale.

### Status Inactivity Rules

The application monitors vehicles with unchanged status for extended periods:

```python
def has_inactive_status(self):
    """Check if a car's status has remained unchanged for too long"""
    if self.date_sold:  # Sold cars are never inactive
        return False
        
    # Get the inactivity threshold from settings
    threshold_days = Setting.get_setting('status_inactivity_threshold_days', 30)
    
    # Check how long since the status was last changed
    last_status_change = self.last_status_changed or self.date_bought
    days_since_change = (datetime.now().date() - last_status_change).days
    
    return days_since_change >= threshold_days
```

This helps identify vehicles that may be stuck in a particular stage of processing.

### Depreciation Tracking

When enabled, the application can track vehicle depreciation over time:

```python
def calculate_current_value(self):
    """Calculate current value taking into account depreciation"""
    if self.date_sold:  # Sold cars use actual sale price
        return self.sale_price
        
    # Check if depreciation tracking is enabled
    depreciation_enabled = Setting.get_setting('enable_depreciation_tracking', False)
    if not depreciation_enabled:
        return self.total_investment
        
    # Calculate days since purchase
    days_owned = (datetime.now().date() - self.date_bought).days
    
    # Apply depreciation formula (example: 15% annual depreciation)
    annual_rate = 0.15
    daily_rate = annual_rate / 365
    depreciation_factor = (1 - daily_rate) ** days_owned
    
    return self.total_investment * depreciation_factor
```

This feature allows for more accurate inventory valuation, particularly for vehicles held for extended periods.

### Data Validation and Sanitization

The application implements input sanitization for vehicle data:

```python
# Example: Vehicle make sanitization
@staticmethod
def sanitize_name(name):
    """Sanitize make name: trim whitespace and capitalize first letter of each word"""
    if not name:
        return None
    # Remove any extra whitespace and capitalize each word
    return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in name.strip().split())
```

This ensures that vehicle makes, models, and colors are stored consistently in the database, enabling better search and reporting capabilities.

### Settings Management

The application provides a flexible settings system for adjusting business rules without code changes:

```python
@classmethod
def get_setting(cls, key, default=None, as_type=None):
    """Get a setting value by key with optional default value"""
    setting = cls.query.filter_by(key=key).first()
    if not setting:
        return default
    
    # Determine conversion type
    convert_type = as_type or setting.type
    
    # Convert value based on type
    try:
        if convert_type == 'int':
            return int(setting.value)
        elif convert_type == 'float':
            return float(setting.value)
        elif convert_type == 'bool':
            return setting.value.lower() in ('true', '1', 'yes', 'y', 'on')
        else:
            return setting.value
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # If conversion fails, return the default
        return default
```

Default settings include:
- `stand_aging_threshold_days`: Number of days after which a car on stand is considered aging (default: 180)
- `status_inactivity_threshold_days`: Number of days after which a car with unchanged status is considered inactive (default: 30)
- `enable_depreciation_tracking`: Toggle for depreciation calculation (default: false)
- `enable_status_warnings`: Toggle for showing status warning indicators (default: true)
- `enable_subform_dropdowns`: Toggle for using dropdown modals for subforms (default: true)
- `enable_dark_mode`: Toggle for UI dark theme (default: false)

### Warning Threshold Logic

The application implements warning logic based on configurable thresholds:

#### Inventory Aging Warnings

When vehicles remain on stand for extended periods, they're identified by warning indicators:

```python
# Get threshold settings
stand_aging_threshold_days = Setting.get_setting('stand_aging_threshold_days', 180, 'int')

# Count vehicles exceeding aging threshold
current_date = datetime.now().date()
aging_threshold_date = current_date - timedelta(days=stand_aging_threshold_days)
aging_warning_date = current_date - timedelta(days=stand_aging_threshold_days / 2)

# Vehicles exceeding threshold (red warning)
vehicles_exceeding_aging = Car.query.filter(
    Car.date_added_to_stand <= aging_threshold_date,
    Car.date_sold == None,
    Car.repair_status == 'On Display'
).count()

# Vehicles approaching threshold - over 50% (yellow warning)
vehicles_approaching_aging = Car.query.filter(
    Car.date_added_to_stand <= aging_warning_date,
    Car.date_added_to_stand > aging_threshold_date,
    Car.date_sold == None,
    Car.repair_status == 'On Display'
).count()
```

The dashboard displays these counts with appropriate color coding:
- Red: Vehicles exceeding stand_aging_threshold_days
- Yellow: Vehicles over 50% of the threshold but not exceeding it
- Green: No vehicles exceeding or approaching the threshold

#### Status Inactivity Warnings

When the `enable_status_warnings` setting is enabled, the system also tracks vehicles with status unchanged for extended periods:

```python
# Get threshold settings
status_inactivity_threshold_days = Setting.get_setting('status_inactivity_threshold_days', 30, 'int')
enable_status_warnings = Setting.get_setting('enable_status_warnings', True, 'bool')

# Status inactivity counts
vehicles_inactive_status = 0
vehicles_approaching_inactive = 0

if enable_status_warnings:
    status_inactive_threshold_date = current_date - timedelta(days=status_inactivity_threshold_days)
    status_warning_threshold_date = current_date - timedelta(days=status_inactivity_threshold_days / 2)
    
    # Count vehicles with inactive status (exceeding threshold)
    # Using a simplified calculation based on status and purchase date
    # In a full implementation, this would use a dedicated last_status_change field
    for car in all_unsold_cars:
        if car.repair_status == 'Waiting for Repairs' and car.date_bought:
            days_since_bought = (current_date - car.date_bought).days
            
            if days_since_bought > status_inactivity_threshold_days:
                vehicles_inactive_status += 1
            elif days_since_bought > status_inactivity_threshold_days / 2:
                vehicles_approaching_inactive += 1
```

The status inactivity warning card follows the same color-coding pattern:
- Red: Vehicles exceeding status_inactivity_threshold_days
- Yellow: Vehicles over 50% of the threshold but not exceeding it
- Green: No vehicles exceeding or approaching the threshold

These warning mechanisms help identify inventory that may require attention or special handling.

### Car-Sale Consistency Checking

The application enforces consistency between car and sale records using event listeners:

```python
@event.listens_for(Car, 'load')
def check_car_sale_consistency(target, context):
    """Ensure car.date_sold is consistent with the associated sale record"""
    # This event is fired when a Car object is loaded from the database
    # We'll defer actual validation until the object is accessed
    target._needs_consistency_check = True

# This is a descriptor that can intercept attribute access
class ConsistencyCheckingDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):
        if obj is None:
            return self
            
        # Check if we need to validate the car's data
        needs_check = getattr(obj, '_needs_consistency_check', True)
        if needs_check:
            # Only do consistency check once
            obj._needs_consistency_check = False
            
            # Perform the actual consistency check
            has_sale = hasattr(obj, 'sale') and obj.sale is not None
            
            if has_sale and obj.date_sold is None:
                # Car has a sale but no date_sold, update it
                obj.date_sold = obj.sale.sale_date
                db.session.merge(obj)
                
            elif has_sale and obj.date_sold != obj.sale.sale_date:
                # date_sold doesn't match sale date, fix it
                obj.date_sold = obj.sale.sale_date
                db.session.merge(obj)
                
            elif obj.date_sold is not None and not has_sale:
                # Car is marked as sold but has no sale record, clear date_sold
                obj.date_sold = None
                db.session.merge(obj)
                
        # Return the result of the is_available property
        return obj.date_sold is None

# Replace the is_available property with our descriptor
Car.is_available = ConsistencyCheckingDescriptor()
```

This ensures that car records and sale records remain synchronized even when modified separately.

### Bulk Import Validation

When importing data in bulk, the application applies validation rules to ensure data quality:

```python
# Example: Car import validation
def import_cars(file: FileStorage) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Import cars from a CSV or Excel file."""
    success_count = 0
    fail_count = 0
    errors = []
    
    # Validate required columns
    required_columns = ['VIN', 'Make', 'Model', 'Year', 'Colour', 'Purchase Price']
    missing_columns = [col for col in required_columns if col not in df.columns]
    if missing_columns:
        errors.append(f"Missing required columns: {', '.join(missing_columns)}")
        return {"success": 0, "failed": 0, "errors": errors}
    
    # Process each row with validation
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        row_errors = []
        
        # Check for required fields
        if pd.isna(row.get('VIN')) or not str(row.get('VIN')).strip():
            row_errors.append('VIN is required')
        
        # Skip row if validation errors
        if row_errors:
            fail_count += 1
            errors.append(f"Row {index+2}: {'; '.join(row_errors)}")
            continue
            
        # Process valid row
        # ...
    
    return {"success": success_count, "failed": fail_count, "errors": errors}
```

This ensures that imported data meets the same validation standards as data entered through the application's user interface.

## Business KPIs and Metrics

The application tracks and calculates several key business metrics:

1. **Average Days to Sell**: Average time from purchase to sale
   ```python
   def average_days_to_sell(start_date=None, end_date=None):
       query = Car.query.filter(Car.date_sold != None)
       if start_date:
           query = query.filter(Car.date_sold >= start_date)
       if end_date:
           query = query.filter(Car.date_sold <= end_date)
           
       cars = query.all()
       if not cars:
           return 0
           
       total_days = sum((car.date_sold - car.date_bought).days for car in cars)
       return total_days / len(cars)
   ```

2. **Average Profit Margin**: Average profit as a percentage of sale price
   ```python
   def average_profit_margin(start_date=None, end_date=None):
       query = Car.query.filter(Car.date_sold != None)
       if start_date:
           query = query.filter(Car.date_sold >= start_date)
       if end_date:
           query = query.filter(Car.date_sold <= end_date)
           
       cars = query.all()
       if not cars:
           return 0
           
       profit_margins = [car.profit_margin for car in cars if car.profit_margin is not None]
       if not profit_margins:
           return 0
           
       return sum(profit_margins) / len(profit_margins)
   ```

3. **Inventory Turnover Rate**: Rate at which inventory is sold and replaced
   ```python
   def inventory_turnover_rate(period_days=30):
       # Count cars sold in period
       end_date = datetime.now().date()
       start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=period_days)
       sold_count = Car.query.filter(
           Car.date_sold >= start_date,
           Car.date_sold <= end_date
       ).count()
       
       # Average inventory during period
       avg_inventory = Car.query.filter(
           or_(
               Car.date_sold == None,
               Car.date_sold >= start_date
           ),
           Car.date_bought <= end_date
       ).count() / 2
       
       if avg_inventory == 0:
           return 0
           
       # Annualized turnover rate
       return (sold_count / avg_inventory) * (365 / period_days)
   ```

4. **Repair Efficiency**: Average repair cost and duration
   ```python
   def repair_efficiency_metrics():
       repairs = Repair.query.filter(Repair.end_date != None).all()
       if not repairs:
           return {'avg_cost': 0, 'avg_duration': 0}
           
       total_cost = sum(repair.repair_cost for repair in repairs)
       total_duration = sum(repair.duration_days for repair in repairs 
                           if repair.duration_days is not None)
       
       return {
           'avg_cost': total_cost / len(repairs),
           'avg_duration': total_duration / len(repairs) if total_duration > 0 else 0
       }
   ```

5. **Repair History Analysis**: Metrics for repair cost and pattern analysis
   ```python
   def avg_cost_per_repair_type(repairs):
       """Calculate average cost per repair type"""
       repair_types = {}
       
       for repair in repairs:
           repair_type = repair.repair_type
           if repair_type not in repair_types:
               repair_types[repair_type] = {'count': 0, 'total_cost': 0}
           
           repair_types[repair_type]['count'] += 1
           repair_types[repair_type]['total_cost'] += float(repair.repair_cost)
       
       # Calculate averages
       for repair_type, data in repair_types.items():
           data['average_cost'] = data['total_cost'] / data['count'] if data['count'] > 0 else 0
       
       return repair_types
   
   def avg_duration_from_purchase(repairs):
       """Calculate average days from purchase to first repair for each car"""
       car_first_repairs = {}
       
       for repair in repairs:
           car_id = repair.car_id
           if car_id in car_first_repairs or not repair.car.date_bought:
               continue
           
           # Calculate days from purchase to repair start
           days_to_first_repair = (repair.start_date - repair.car.date_bought).days
           car_first_repairs[car_id] = days_to_first_repair
       
       # Calculate average
       if not car_first_repairs:
           return 0
       return sum(car_first_repairs.values()) / len(car_first_repairs)
       
   def repair_count_per_car(repairs):
       """Calculate repair count per car"""
       car_counts = {}
       
       for repair in repairs:
           car_id = repair.car_id
           if car_id not in car_counts:
               car_counts[car_id] = 0
           car_counts[car_id] += 1
       
       return car_counts
   ```

## Business Validation Rules

The application implements numerous validation rules to ensure data integrity:

1. **Price Validation**:
   ```python
   def validate_price(price):
       if price is None:
           return None
       
       try:
           price = float(price)
       except (ValueError, TypeError):
           raise ValidationError("Price must be a valid number")
           
       if price < 0:
           raise ValidationError("Price cannot be negative")
           
       return price
   ```

2. **Date Validation**:
   ```python
   def validate_date_sequence(start_date, end_date):
       if end_date and start_date and end_date < start_date:
           raise ValidationError("End date cannot be earlier than start date")
   ```

3. **Required Field Validation**:
   ```python
   def validate_required_fields(data, required_fields):
       for field in required_fields:
           if field not in data or data[field] is None or data[field] == '':
               raise ValidationError(f"Field '{field}' is required")
   ```

4. **Status Transition Validation**:
   ```python
   def validate_status_transition(current_status, new_status):
       valid_transitions = {
           'Waiting for Repairs': ['In Repair', 'Ready for Display'],
           'In Repair': ['Ready for Display'],
           'Ready for Display': ['On Display'],
           'On Display': ['Sold'],
           'Sold': []
       }
       
       if new_status not in valid_transitions.get(current_status, []):
           raise ValidationError(f"Cannot transition from '{current_status}' to '{new_status}'")
   ```

These business rules and calculations ensure the application operates according to the specified business requirements and provides accurate financial and operational metrics.

## System Settings

The application includes a configurable settings system that affects various aspects of business logic and application behavior.

### Setting Storage and Retrieval

Settings are stored in the database using a flexible key-value storage model:

```python
# Getting a setting with a default fallback value
threshold_days = Setting.get_setting('stand_aging_threshold_days', 180)

# Setting a value with type and description
Setting.set_setting(
    'enable_depreciation_tracking',
    True,
    description='Track depreciation of vehicles over time',
    type='bool'
)
```

### Core Settings and Their Effects

| Setting Key | Type | Default | Description | Effect |
|-------------|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `stand_aging_threshold_days` | int | 180 | Number of days after which a car on a stand is considered aging | Controls when vehicles are flagged as "aging" in inventory reports; affects inventory aging warnings |
| `status_inactivity_threshold_days` | int | 30 | Number of days after which a car with unchanged status is considered inactive | Determines when vehicles are flagged as "inactive" in status reports; affects operational efficiency metrics |
| `enable_depreciation_tracking` | bool | false | Track depreciation of vehicles over time | When enabled, activates depreciation calculations in financial reports and vehicle valuation |
| `enable_status_warnings` | bool | true | Show warnings for vehicles with stale status | Controls whether the system displays warnings for vehicles with inactive status |
| `enable_subform_dropdowns` | bool | true | Use dropdown modals for subforms | UI preference that affects how subforms are displayed in the interface |
| `enable_dark_mode` | bool | false | Switch to a dark theme for the interface | UI preference that toggles between light and dark interface themes |

### Application of Settings

Settings are applied throughout the application in various contexts:

```python
# Example: Using settings in business logic
def check_vehicle_aging(vehicle):
    """Flag vehicles that have been on stand too long"""
    threshold = Setting.get_setting('stand_aging_threshold_days', 180)
    
    if vehicle.days_on_stand and vehicle.days_on_stand > threshold:
        return True  # Vehicle is aging
    return False  # Vehicle is within normal timeframe
```

```python
# Example: Using settings in a route
@app.route('/inventory')
def inventory():
    show_warnings = Setting.get_setting('enable_status_warnings', True)
    return render_template('inventory.html', show_warnings=show_warnings)
```

### Setting Categories

Settings are organized into logical groups for management:

1. **Thresholds & Rules** - Numerical thresholds and business rule toggles
2. **General Configuration** - Interface and general application preferences
3. **User Management** - Settings related to user accounts and permissions

### Access Control for Settings

Settings management is restricted to administrators:

```python
@settings_bp.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
@requires_role('admin')
def index():
    # Settings management code
```

This ensures that only authorized users can modify system-wide configurations.

## Repair Provider Management

The application tracks and manages relationships with repair providers.

### Provider Relationship Model

The `RepairProvider` model maintains information about service providers:

```python
class RepairProvider(db.Model):
    """RepairProvider model representing the repair_providers table"""
    __tablename__ = 'repair_providers'

    provider_id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    provider_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    service_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    contact_info = db.Column(db.String(150), nullable=True)
    location = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=True)
    notes = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    date_added = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.now, nullable=False)
    rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # Rating out of 5

    # Add the repairs relationship
    repairs = db.relationship('Repair', back_populates='provider')
```

### Provider Performance Tracking

The application includes functionality to track and analyze provider performance:

1. **Total Repairs Handled**: Count of all repairs assigned to a provider
2. **Average Repair Cost**: Average cost of repairs done by the provider
3. **Average Repair Duration**: Average time taken to complete repairs
4. **Cost/Duration Efficiency Ratio**: Metric to measure provider efficiency

The `RepairProvider` model includes properties for these metrics:

```python
@property
def total_repairs(self):
    """Get the total number of repairs handled by this provider"""
    return len(self.repairs)

@property
def total_repair_cost(self):
    """Get the total cost of all repairs done by this provider"""
    return sum(repair.repair_cost for repair in self.repairs) if self.repairs else 0

@property
def average_repair_duration(self):
    """Calculate the average repair duration in days"""
    completed_repairs = [r for r in self.repairs if r.end_date is not None]
    if not completed_repairs:
        return None
    durations = [(r.end_date - r.start_date).days for r in completed_repairs]
    return sum(durations) / len(durations) if durations else None
```

These metrics are used in the Provider Efficiency Report to compare and analyze provider performance. For more details, see the [Provider Efficiency Report](/docs/07-reports.md#provider-efficiency-report) section.

### Provider Selection Logic

When assigning repairs, the system considers:

1. Provider service type match
2. Provider availability
3. Historical performance metrics
4. Proximity to current location (when available)

### Part Inventory Management

The application includes an inventory management system for parts that automatically adjusts stock quantities when parts are used in repairs or removed from repairs. This ensures accurate tracking of available parts.

#### Part Stock Management

Parts in the system have a `stock_quantity` field that tracks current inventory. Key features:

- The `stock_quantity` must always be greater than or equal to 0 (enforced by database constraint)
- Parts can be filtered by their stock status to identify items needing reorder
- Vehicle-specific parts can be filtered by make and model
- Parts can be assigned a storage location for physical inventory management

#### Part Duplication Detection

The Part model includes an `is_duplicate` method to detect potential duplicate parts in the system:

```python
def is_duplicate(self, name, make=None, model=None):
    """
    Check if a part with the same name, make, and model already exists
    
    Args:
        name (str): Part name to check
        make (str, optional): Vehicle make
        model (str, optional): Vehicle model
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if a duplicate exists, False otherwise
    """
    # Convert values for case-insensitive comparison
    name = name.lower().strip() if name else None
    make = make.lower().strip() if make else None
    model = model.lower().strip() if model else None
    
    # Check for parts with the same name (case-insensitive)
    query = Part.query.filter(db.func.lower(Part.part_name).strip() == name)
    
    # Add make filter if provided
    if make:
        query = query.filter(db.func.lower(Part.make).strip() == make)
        
    # Add model filter if provided
    if model:
        query = query.filter(db.func.lower(Part.model).strip() == model)
        
    # Check if any parts match the criteria (excluding self)
    existing_parts = query.filter(Part.part_id != self.part_id).all()
    
    return len(existing_parts) > 0
```

This method performs a case-insensitive and spacing-insensitive check to identify potential duplicate parts, taking into account vehicle-specific attributes. This helps maintain data quality and prevents creating redundant inventory items.

#### Part Decrement Logic

When a part is added to a repair, the system follows these rules:

```python
# Check part stock and decrement if greater than 0
if part.stock_quantity > 0:
    part.stock_quantity -= 1
    flash(f'{part.part_name} added to repair successfully. Stock decremented to {part.stock_quantity}.', 'success')
else:
    flash(f'Warning: {part.part_name} has no stock (0 quantity). Part added to repair without changing inventory.', 'warning')
```

Key business rules:
- If the part has available stock (stock_quantity > 0), decrement the stock by 1
- If the part has zero stock, allow its use in the repair but do not decrement further
- Display a warning message when using a part with zero stock
- Never allow stock to go negative

#### Part Increment Logic

When a part is removed from a repair, the stock is incremented:

```python
# If we have a valid part, increment its stock
if part:
    # Record the current stock for messaging
    old_stock = part.stock_quantity
    
    # Increment the part's stock
    part.stock_quantity += 1
    
    db.session.delete(repair_part)
    db.session.commit()
```

This ensures that parts removed from repairs are returned to inventory, maintaining accurate stock levels.

#### Part Replacement Logic

When a part is changed on repair edit:
1. The old part's stock is incremented by 1 (if present)
2. The new part's stock is decremented by 1 (unless it's already at 0)

This swap process ensures proper inventory tracking when parts are exchanged in the repair process.

#### Inventory Warnings

The system provides visual feedback about inventory actions:
- Success messages show the updated stock quantity after each operation
- Warning messages alert users when they're using parts that have zero inventory
- This helps prevent accidental use of unavailable parts while still allowing flexibility when needed

This inventory management approach balances accuracy with operational flexibility, allowing repair work to continue even when parts inventory is depleted.
